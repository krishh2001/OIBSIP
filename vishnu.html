    <p><strong>Life:</strong>  Bhagat Singh was born on September 28, 1907, in Banga, Punjab, which is now in Pakistan. He hailed from a Sikh family with a history of participation in revolutionary activities against British rule.</p>
    <p><strong>Revolutionary Activities:</strong>  Bhagat Singh became involved in revolutionary activities at a young age. He was deeply influenced by the Jallianwala Bagh massacre in 1919 and the unjust treatment of Indians under British rule. He joined the Hindustan Republican Association (HRA), which later became the Hindustan Socialist Republican Association (HSRA), and actively participated in various revolutionary activities aimed at overthrowing British rule in India.</p>
    <p><strong>Legislative Assembly Bombing:</strong>  One of the most notable acts of resistance led by Bhagat Singh was the bombing of the Central Legislative Assembly in Delhi on April 8, 1929. Along with his associate Batukeshwar Dutt, Bhagat Singh threw non-lethal smoke bombs in the assembly to protest against the repressive laws imposed by the British government. This act was intended to symbolize the revolutionaries' defiance of British authority.</p>
    <p><strong>Arrest and Trial:</strong> Bhagat Singh was arrested for his involvement in the Central Legislative Assembly bombing. During his trial, he used the courtroom as a platform to propagate his revolutionary ideals and expose the injustices of British colonial rule. He and his associates were charged with murder and conspiracy, leading to a highly publicized trial.</p>
    <p><strong>Execution:</strong> Despite widespread public support and protests demanding clemency, Bhagat Singh, along with Rajguru and Sukhdev, was sentenced to death by hanging. They were executed on March 23, 1931, in Lahore Central Jail. Their martyrdom galvanized the Indian independence movement and inspired countless others to join the struggle for freedom.</p>
    <p><strong>Legacy:</strong> Bhagat Singh's sacrifice and revolutionary ideals continue to inspire generations of Indians. He is widely regarded as a national hero and an icon of India's freedom struggle. His commitment to secularism, socialism, and the emancipation of the oppressed remains relevant in contemporary India.</p>
    <strong>Bhagat Singh's legacy continues to inspire generations of Indians to fight against injustice and oppression.</strong>
